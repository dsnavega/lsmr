Description: This package implements as linear regression as surrogate model
        for more complex and black-box models. First predictors are decorrelated
        using ZCA, then a linear model is fitted in the ZCA space. Several properties
        that improve interpretation arise naturally. Based on work by
        Zuber and Strimmer (2011) and Biecek and Burzykowski (2021)
